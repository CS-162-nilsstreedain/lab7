## Begin Program 3 Design/Implementation (14 pts)
Show your TA that you are making an effort to setting up the polymorphism aspects of Program 3 as well as the constructors, accessors, mutators, etc. This could be showing all of your .h files being set up in code or showing a thorough design of each class and their relation to each other. Each class's design or .h file is worth 2 pts.
